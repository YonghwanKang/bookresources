# Book Resources

Throughout the past several years, I have really gotten into programming through reading books on a wide variety of topics.
I typically buy used or use ebooks, and one thing that I have noticed is that there is a severe lack of the "Resource Discs"
contents being available online. Apress and PacktPub have done great jobs at ensuring that the code contents from their books
is pretty easily available online, but that isn't the case for all publishers or those books that are no longer published.

I have been slowly going through all of the books that I have purchased and have been ripping the resource discs so that I
can change that and share the contents with the Internet. I hope that one day this can be a community effort to restore all
of the lost resources.

To keep things from getting too cluttered, this repo will only contain code assets, but the full ISOs are available on the

## Current Categories

Currently most of the resource discs that I have are from a variety of game development books, books on programming languages,
and more computer-sciencey things.

1) Game Development
2) Programming Languages
