                  Description of the companion CD to
   "CD Protection against copying" book by Kris Kaspersky
************************************************************************

The comapnion CD contains all of the required utilities for the analysis  
and copying of protected CDs. Note that bypassing the protection against 
CD copying is not the same thing as copyright violation! The laws of many 
countries explicitly allow the creation of backup copies of licensed media.
The PHILIPS Corporation, which is one of the inventors of CD technology, 
strongly opposes any deviations from the standard and insists on that protected 
discs that CDs including anti-copying technology should not use the "Compact Disc" 
logo. Legislation in many countries supports this stance. Any disc protected by 
a non-standard format must be marked with an unequivocal warning that, although 
the piece of plastic you are purchasing bears a resemblance to a CD, in reality, 
it is not a proper CD. 

Furthermore, to develop CD protection mechanisms, the programmer must have at least 
a general idea about the working methods and technical tools used by his or her opponents. 
To master this technical arsenal at a level no lower than that of the opponent 
is even better. Simply speaking, it allows us to detect and reinforce the most 
probable targets against hacker attacks, concentrating on them the maximum 
available intellectual resources. This means that the developer of protection 
mechanisms must be inspired by the hacker psychology, and start thinking like a hacker.
Thus, mastering information-protection technology assumes the mastering of 
cracking technology. If you don't know how protection mechanisms are cracked, 
what their vulnerabilities are, and have no information about the hacker’s arsenal, 
you won't be able to create a strong protection mechanism that is, 
at once, inexpensive and easy to implement. 

THe SRC directory contains all the source code of the demo examples
used in this book. 

ETC       -  Demo examples for low-level access to CD-ROM drives
RS.LIB    -  Libraries for low-level working with CD sectors from 
             CloneCD and Ahead Nero and interfaces to them, with examples
             illustrating their practical use
RS.SIMPLE -  Elementary examples illustrating the principle of Reed-Solomon
             codes
SCSI.ALT  -  Source code of the driver allowing executiong of the IN/OUT
             machine commands from the application level
SCSI.LIB  -  Tools and utilities developed by the author for working
             with protected CDs

Root directory  - many small but useful utilities, including the Pinch of File
block file copier useful for file-by-file copying of CDs containing files with
incorrect lengths and starting sectors.
