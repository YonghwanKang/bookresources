Short Description:
	There are some animations which I prepared especially for my article for GPM
	book. It has been done, because of my experience with programs, source codes,
	compilers, enviroments, operating systems. Sometimes everything is going to crash, 
	but you always have possibility to run an animation (however, remember, that 
	programs which are given on a CD will run faster, and results will be more 
	detailed drawn.

Files:

	file:		flag.m1v
	type:		mpeg-1
	duration:	12 [s]
	description:
			Example of constrained cloth simulation. As we see - no stretching occurs.



	file:		SoftBody1.m1v
	type:		mpeg-1
	duration:	7 [s]
	description:
			Soft body colliding with two walls. Visualization with velocity vectors.



	file:		SoftBody2.m1v
	type:		mpeg-1
	duration:	8 [s]
	description:
			Two Soft Bodies with better visualization (enviroment mapping, lighting) with velocity
			and normal vectors on one of them.
