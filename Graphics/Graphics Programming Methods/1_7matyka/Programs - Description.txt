Short Description:
	That two programs illustrates the techniques presented in my article for th GPM book.
	Both of them are based on the same engine and are compiled from provided source code.
	

	Flag.exe - program which simulate constrained cloth behaviour. Feel free to change texture file,
		but remember - it have to be .bmp file with 2^n size in x and y direction.
	SoftBody.exe - simualtion of two soft bodies. Bodies dont interact with each other. Bodies
		are putted in 3D rotating box, so they move very nice.

Requirements:
	- Windows operating system (tested on W98 only)
	- GLUT extension support (important: glut32.dll inside of the program directory)

Keys:

		
	';' -	move y+
	'.' -   move y-
	'/' -   move x+
	',' -   move x-
	'k' -   translate z+
	'l' -	translate z-
	'+' -   scale x
	'-' -	scale y

	'8' - anglex+
	'2' - anglex-
	'6' - angley+
	'4' - angley-
	'7' - anglez+
	'9' - anglez-
	'5' - reset angle & position to some constans value
