Acknowledgements:
We would like to thank Kenny Mitchell (Westwood Studios) for the terrain engine
and Solomon Srinivasan (Paraform Inc) for help with the creating the demo.


Requirements:
1. A Vertex Shader 1.0 & Pixel Shader 1.0 compliant hardware.
2. DX8.1
3. Win 2000



To Run:
Launch the app and hit Play on the menu to run the demo.
Alternatively, you could also play with the sliders to get a feel and 
understand the features of the scattering model.
Sliders:
Note: You probably would want to move the sun slider first to a midday 
position to see something on the screen.

You could also maneuver camera with the following keys.
Up, Down - Move forward/backward
Left,Right - Yaw
PgUp,PgDn - Pitch
Home,End - Move up/down
F9,F11 - Roll
F5,F6 - Stepsize decr/incr



Bugs:
The cursor keys while changing camera affect the sliders too.
