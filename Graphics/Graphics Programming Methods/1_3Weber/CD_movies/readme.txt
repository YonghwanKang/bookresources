Real-time Multi-Resolution Dynamics of Deeply Hierarchical Bodies

Included in these directory are MPEG1 files demonstrating various effects
on a fairly basic tree of about 250 nodes.  This is the same configuration
used for the article's figures.

sinewind.mpg
Fully resolved tree in a sine wave of horizontal wind with an amplitude
of 10 m/s.

breakage.mpg
Fully resolved tree with breakage activated subjected to three explosions
in succession.

chop.mpg
Fully resolved tree with breakage activated with one trunk spring removed.

fullres.mpg
A single explosion next to a fully resolved tree.

lock.mpg
A single explosion next to a tree with many nodes locked.

replication.mpg
A single explosion next to a tree with many nodes blindly copying the angles
of other nodes.

If you want to see the source code, write to Intel.  At the last minute,
they pulled all support for the article and blocked the distribution of
my neatly packaged demo code.  If you need names, email me.
