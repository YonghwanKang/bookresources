PN Triangles Demo 
-----------------

This demo uses OpenGL and the GLU Toolkit (GLUT) to
demonstrate Curved PN triangles. It has been
built using Visual C++ v6.0.

The demo will not run unless it can find the DLL file
glut32.dll so you may wish to copy this to your Windows 
system folder.

The included files are:

	demo.exe   - Windows EXE demo program.
	demo	   - Folder containing Visual C files.
	glut       - Folder containing GLUT files.
	demo.c     - Demo program source code.
	pntri.c    - PN triangles source code.
	pntri.h    - PN triangles header file.
	readme.txt - This file.

Press the space bar in the demo to toggle the different
primitives to display. They are:

	* Flat triangles
	* PN filter triangles
	* PN primitive triangles with one curved edge
	* PN primitive triangles with two curved edges
	* PN primitive triangles with three curved edges
	* PN quad primitive

Use the keys 0 to 5 to change the level of detail and
the "w" key to toggle wireframe display.

The escape key will close the graphics window.
