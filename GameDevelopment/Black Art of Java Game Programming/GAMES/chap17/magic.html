<title>The Magic Squares</title><h1><center>
Play a games of magic squares!</h1></center>
<br>

<br>
My latest applet is an adaptation (pronounced "ripoff") of game #5 on my old
Merlin handheld game.  The game is magic square and the object is to get all
of the squares to be the same color.  Clicking on the square will increment the
color of the square as well of as increment the squares around it.  The number
of squares and number of colors can be modified, although I must say that
at this time I have never got past 9 squares with only three colors.  I'm going
to be working alot on this one and I want to add a high score save and  I've 
finally gotten around to putting in a solve.  Just 
press the solve button at any time and a thread will start hacking
away at solving the current board.  The final out put will be in pairs
of numbers indicating the square to click on in x,y fashion.  For an 
interesting experience, try to solve the puzzle before your computer.  Enjoy!
