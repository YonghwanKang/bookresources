<H4>How to play</H4>

<P>
Press any key or click on the applet to start the game. The <B>Start</B> button changes to a <B>Pause</B> and
then <B>Resume</B> button. Use it to stop and start play. You can also use the <B>ESC</B> key to pause a game.
<P>
To control the worm use either the mouse to click ahead and to the side of the blue worm to change its 
direction. You may also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to change the worm's direction.
<P>
Avoid crashing into the wall or another worm, even your own. 
When you crash, the segment that you crash into is colored red and the game stops. Restart the game as detailed above.
