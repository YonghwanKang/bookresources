<h1>Point of the Game</h1>
<font color="000000">

In this game, you must help that ingenious time traveller,
Doctor Who <img src=dw1r.gif>, 
avoid ever-growing swarms of your arch-enemies, the Daleks
<img src=dalekr.gif>. You are armed only with your trusty Sonic
Screwdriver, an ability to teleport to random destinations, and your
unrivaled intellect.

<p>Luckily, what the Daleks have in numbers, they lack in intelligence.
In their reckless pursuit, they can crash into one another, leaving
piles of rubble <img src=daldr.gif>. Any Daleks trying to move through
rubble will also be destroyed.<br>
<br>

<font color="cc0000">
<h1>The Keyboard</h1>
<font color="000000">
The game is entirely keyboard controlled.  All available commands are
listed below.<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Movement</b><br>
Move the Doctor by using the numeric keypad.  Pressing <b>"5"</b> will pass for the turn.  Diagonal movement is allowed.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Teleport</b><br>
You can teleport by hitting <b>"T"</b>.  Note that you have no control over your destination.  Use this ability wisely or you may find yourself ignominiously crushed under the wheels of the pursuing Daleks.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Sonic Screwdriver</b><br>
Hit <b>"S"</b> to use one of your sonic screwdrivers.  These handy little devices only work once, but will destroy any Daleks adjacent to you.  The number of remaining screwdrivers is displayed at the bottom of the screen.  Additional screwdrivers are awarded upon completion of every level.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Last Stand</b><br>
When all else fails, pressing <b>"L"</b> will make a final stand, allowing the Daleks to keep moving until either the Doctor or all the Daleks have been killed.
</ul>

<font color="cc0000">
<h1>Scoring</h1>
<font color="000000">

As you progress to higher levels, the Daleks destroyed are worth
increasing numbers of points.  No score is given for Daleks destroyed
with the sonic screwdriver.

<p>The scoring rules have changed from previous versions, so that heavy
use of the sonic screwdriver could result in lower scores, even at higher
levels.  Fewer points are awarded for each Dalek destroyed.

<h1>Notes</h1>
<font color="000000">
<img src=dw1l.gif align=right>
As you start reaching higher levels, you may notice some unexpected
changes (even stranger if you have never seen the TV show).
Do not be alarmed. This is not a bug - it's a feature..

<p><img src=dalekr.gif align=left>The game design is heavily indebted
to the author(s) of the Macintosh shareware game written about 10
years ago. I still find myself playing it during lulls on the Internet.

<p>If you liked this version of Daleks, send me <b>
<a href=mailto:koehler@www.execpc.com>e-mail</a></b>.
I am very open to making enhancements.  In fact, I have a few in
mind myself (Cybermen?)
