<h2> What is the Internet MahJong Server? </h2>
The Internet MahJong Server (IMS) is a software package that provides
virtual gambling rooms for the popular Chinese tile game MahJong.
<p>
IMS requires minimal computer knowledge to connect and play.
All you need is a Web browser that understands 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>, for example, the
<a href="http://www.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/index.html">
Netscape Navigator</a>.
<p>
IMS provides functionality comparable to OKbridge, the GO servers, the
Chess servers, and other Internet game sites.
There is full support for playing MahJong games, observing games,
and communicating with other players.
The server keeps track of each player's score, along with his
personal information.
<p>
IMS does all this with an intuitive graphical user interface.
In this 0.2 version, it has been beefed up to be comparable to 
commercial applications.

<a name="Connect"></a>
<h2> Connecting to a Server </h2>
To start, you are advised to go to the
<a href="http://www.math.princeton.edu/~ztfeng/mj_servers.html">
Internet MahJong Meta-Server</a>.
There you will find a list of all public MahJong servers, their URL,
and brief descriptions about them.
Choose a site nearest to you, and click on the link to go there.
<p>
Typically, you'll be greeted by the main Web page of that server.
It will present to you various information relevant to MahJong in
general and that server in particular.
Most importantly, your Web browser will start loading a Java applet,
the <B>client</B>.
It may take a while, but eventually you will see a big button on the
Web page, labeled <B>Connect NOW!</B>.

<a name="Login">
<h2> Logging in to the Server </h2>
Click on the <B>Connect NOW!</B> button.
The client will now actually make the connection to the MahJong server,
and present you with a login window.
<p>
Now it's time to think for a name you wish to use on IMS.
It could be anything, so use your imagination!
Also think for a password that you can remember, but is hard to guess.
<p>
<B>Important</B>: since the password is currently stored in a database on
the server <B>without</B> encription, your password is readable by the
server administrator and perhaps other people on the machine on which 
the server is running.  <B>DO NOT</B> use the password for any of your
computer accounts!
<p>
Now, type in your name and password.  If this is the first time you login
on this server, click on the <B>New Player</B> button.  Otherwise, click on
the <B>Login</B> button.
<p>
Your login request may be rejected due to one of the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>	If you clicked on <B>New Player</B>, but there is already a player
	with your name in the server's player database.
<li>	If you clicked on <B>Login</B>, but you haven't logged in to this
	server with this name before.
<li>	If you clicked on <B>Login</B>, but supplied a bad password.
<li>	If there is already a player logged in to this server with the
	name you have chosen.  If you were logged in and had a broken
	connection, your slot will be cleared after about 2 minutes.
</ul>

<a name="Overview"></a>
<h2> Overview of the IMS Console Window </h2>
This is what a typical IMS console window looks like (snapshot taken with
Netscape Navigator 2.0 for X Window):
<br>
<center>
<img src="images/mj_view.gif">
</center>
<p>
In the top half of the window, you will find a <B>player list</B> in the
upper left corner, a <B>table list</B> in the upper right corner,
a <B>message panel</B> immediately below them, 
the <B>message text field</B>, and a bunch of buttons.
This portion of the window is called the <B>console</B>.
<p>
Below the console is the <B>desktop</B> of your MahJong table.
When you first login, you are not on any table, so the desktop should
look pretty much empty.
<p>
On the very top of the window, you will find a menu bar containing
the following items:
<ul>
<li>	<B>File</B>.  This menu has a single choice: <B>Quit</B>.  This is
	how you leave the server.  As a courtesy to your fellow players,
	please do not quit while in the middle of a game.
<li>	<a href="#Player"><B>Players</B></a>.  
	Here you can choose to change your password, or obtain personal
	information of other players currently on the server.
<li>	<a href="#Table"><B>Table</B></a>.  
	This is where you serve a new table, or join an
	existing one.  You can also set some options for your table.
<li>	<B>Preferences</B>.  You can configure your client here.
<li>	<B>Help</B>.  Ask for help.  This will usually bring up help
	documents in your Web browser, so you need to read them there.
</ul>

<a name="Comm"></a>
<h2> Communicating with Other Players </h2>
You may send messages to everyone on the server, everyone on your table,
or to the server administrator ("God").  You choose the destination of
your message in the multiple choice button right next to the
message text field.  You cannot send messages to individual players.
This makes cheating harder.
<p>
Now, simply type your message in the message text field, and press the
<B>return</B> key, or the <B>Send</B> button.  It is as simple as that.
If you mess up and want to start over, simply click on the <B>Clear</B>
button.
<p>
Messages sent to you will be accumulated in the big message panel.  If it
gets too full, you can click on the <B>Purge</B> button to clear the entire
message panel.

<a name="Player"></a>
<h2> Player Information </h2>
The player list in the upper left corner of the console window
shows a list of all players currently on the server.
Each row in the list corresponds to a player.
The columns from left to right show the player ID, name, total score,
table ID, and host machine.
<p>
In the <B>Players</B> menu, choose <B>Finger</B> to bring up a finger
information window.
<p>
There are several ways to finger a player.
The quickiest is double-clicking on his entry in the player list.
This also brings up the finger information window automatically.
Or, click on his entry and choose <B>Finger</B> from the <B>Players</B> menu.
You can also type his ID in the ID# text field of the finger information
window, and click on <RETURN> or click on the <B>Finger</B> button.
<p>
You will now see his E-mail address, home page URL, and a "plan".
Of course, you won't see anything but empty space if that player hadn't
put these information there!
<p>
To update your own information so that other players can see it,
click on <B>Finger self</B>.
Now you will see your own information, and you will be able to edit it.
When you are done, click on <B>Update self</B> to store the updated information
on the server.
<p>
<B>Important</B>: The finger information takes up space on the server side,
and network bandwidth every time a finger request is processed.  Please
keep your finger information brief, and don't flood the server with finger
requests!
<p>
You can also change your password.  In the <B>Players</B> menu, choose
<B>Change Password</B>.  This will bring up a dialog window.
Type in your old password, and your new password twice, and click on
<B>OK</B>.  The change takes effect immediately.

<a name="Table"></a>
<h2> MahJong Tables </h2>
MahJong games are played on <B>tables</B>, with 4 <B>players</B>.
A table can also have several <B>spectators</B> who only observe the game.
<p>
There is a table list in the upper right corner of the console window.
Each row in the list corresponds to a table.
The columns from left to right show the table ID, 
a brief description its options (see below),
and the IDs of its players.
<p>
Table options affect (to some minor extent) how games are played and
how scores are calculated.  Basic rules and the scoring system are
the same across tables, these options only provide minor variations.
See <a href="mj_rules.html#Opts">MahJong Rules: IMS Table Opotions</a> 
for a description of these options.
<p>
In the <B>Table</B> menu, select <B>Info</B> to bring up a
table information window.
Type an ID in its ID# field to get the information of that table.
Double-clicking a table entry in the table list has the same effect.
The table information window shows in detail that table's options,
the IDs and names of players on that table,
tells you which table you are on, and also gives you the ability to
join, serve, or leave tables, or to change your table's options.
<p>
To serve a new table, either select <B>Serve</B> from the <B>Table</B> menu,
or click on the <B>Serve</B> button in the table information window.  
You will be seated in the special seat for the creator of the table.
Only you (or the one that replaces you when you leave your table) have the
privilege to set or change that table's options.
<p>
You may make changes to your table's options in the table information window.
Clicking on the "Apply" button applies your changes to the table.
Note that only the creator can change options, and then only when no
game is in progress.
<p>
You may also serve a private table.  To do so, send the command
<TT><B>/serve</B></TT> as a message to God (the server administrator).
Send <TT><B>/invite 3</B></TT> to God to invite player #3, and
<TT><B>/invite -3</B></TT> to uninvite him again.
To invite or uninvite several players, put all their ID numbers after the
<TT><B>/invite</B></TT> command, with a <TT><B>-</B></TT> sign to uninvite.
The server will send a message to invited players asking them to join
your table.  Whether they do so is entirely up to them.
Only invited players can join your private table to play, but anyone can join
to observe.
<p>
To join an existing table, select <B>Join</B> from the <B>Table</B> menu,
or click on the <B>Join</B> button in the table information window.
This brings up a dialog window.  Type in the ID number of the table you 
want to join.  The client may have put a default ID number there (the table
you currently have info on).  
To join the table as a spector (for watching others play), choose
<B>Spectator</B> instead of the default <B>Player</B>.  Now click on the
<B>Join</B> button.  Your join table request may be denied if the table
is full, or is a private one and you aren't invited.  If your join request
is successful, you will be assigned a random seat.  However, if the original
creator of the table has left, then you will always take his seat even if
there are other open seats.
<p>
To leave a table, select <B>Leave</B> in the <B>Table</B> menu,
or click on the <B>Leave</B> button in the table information window.
As a courtesy to the other players, please finish your current game before
leaving your table.  There is a 5 point penalty for being the first to
leave a table with a game in progress. Also, please don't "hog" a table.  
If there is a game in progress and you are idle for 2 minutes, 
the server will automatically kick you off the table and 
give you a 5 point penalty.

<a name="Desktop"></a>
<h2> Desktop of a MahJong Table </h2>
This section is best read together with
<a href="mj_rules.html">MahJong Rules</a>.
<p>
The desktop window is a graphic representation of your MahJong table.
<p>
There are 5 large gray areas that are used to show tiles.
If you are playing the game, your private, concealed tiles will always
be shown in the long gray area at the bottom.  You can arrange these tiles
by clicking and dragging.  The tiles that you reveal in the process of the 
game will be displayed in the gray area just above your private tiles.
The other 3 gray areas display tiles (concealed and revealed) of the other
3 players.  Their private, concealed tiles will only show up with a gray
shade, so you can only see their revealed tiles.  You cannot arrange any
revealed tiles of your own nor any tiles of the other players.
<p>
In the center of the desktop you'll find a small gray area.  This place
is for tiles that players discard during the game.  It only has space for
the most recently discarded tile (the tile in auction).  Previously discarded
tiles go into the <B>tile pool</B> window.  You can bring this window up
by selecting <B>Show Pool</B> in the <B>Table</B> menu.
<p>
Around the central gray area you will find labels that show you the name,
score, and seat wind of all the players on your table.  Note that the
<B>seat wind</B> is a MahJong jargon, it actually rotates in the reverse order
of the compass directions.
<p>
If you are a spectator, then the positions of the 4 players' tiles will
change from game to game.  The <B>dealer</B> (with seat wind <B>east</B>)
for any particular game will always be displayed at the bottom.
<p>
In the middle of the desktop window you will also find text labels that 
display the options of the table, the round wind of the game,
the number of tiles left in the game, and explanations of what is going on.
These should make sense once you know the rules of MahJong.
<p>
At the very bottom of the desktop window, you will find a row of buttons.
Among those, <B>Show Pool</B> brings up the tile pool window, <B>Sort</B>
sorts your private tiles.  The other buttons all correspond to particular
actions you can make during the course of a MahJong game.  They are
described in <a href="mj_rules.html#Game">MahJong Rules: A MahJong Game</a>.
<p>
There is a Duke figure and an <B>Urge</B> button to the left and right of
the long gray area near the bottom of the desktop window.
When there is a game in progress, you may click on the <B>Urge</B> button to
ask them to hurry up.
If your urge request is accepted, everyone on the table will be alerted.
The alert takes in the form of the Duke waving at you, and (depending on
the system configuration) a "cuckoo" sound.
<p>
For players with a small monitor, the desktop window can be detached from
the main console window by selecting <B>Split Desktop</B> from the
<B>Preferences</B> menu.

<a name="Pref"></a>
<h2> User Preferences </h2>
You can configure the appearance of your client to suit your hardware or
personal taste, and save it on the server so your client looks the same
the next time you login.
<p>
You can set the number of rows and columns used by the player list, table
list, and message panels.  To do so, simply select <B>Set Geometry</B> in
the <B>Preferences</B> menu to bring up the dialog window, enter your
desired values, and click on <B>Apply</B>.
<p>
IMS keeps track of 3 fonts, the <B>label font</B>, the <B>message font</B>,
and the <B>button font</b>.  They are used in many (but not all) text labels,
the player and table lists, the message windows, and the game action buttons.
You can change the font family, size, and style of these 3 fonts by selecting
the appropriate item in the <B>Preferences</B> menu.  This will bring up a
dialog window with the family, size, and style of the font.  You may make
your choice and click on <B>Apply</B> to see the effects.
<p>
Finally, select <B>Save Preferences</B> in the <B>Preferences</B> menu to
save your configuration on the server.

<a name="Finale"></a>
<h2> Final Words </h2>
The Internet MahJong Servers are social centers.  Please be kind to observe
the usual etiquettes.  Let's cooperate with each other to make the MahJong
servers a comfortable cyberhome for you and other MahJong lovers.
<p>
Happy MahJonging!
