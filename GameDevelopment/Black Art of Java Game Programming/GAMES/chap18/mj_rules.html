<h2> MahJong Tiles </h2>
There are a total of 144 tiles in MahJong, they can be classified into the
following categories:
<h3> The Character Suit </h3>
<img src="tiles/T1.gif">
<img src="tiles/T2.gif">
<img src="tiles/T3.gif">
<img src="tiles/T4.gif">
<img src="tiles/T5.gif">
<img src="tiles/T6.gif">
<img src="tiles/T7.gif">
<img src="tiles/T8.gif">
<img src="tiles/T9.gif">
<h3> The Ball Suit </h3>
<img src="tiles/T10.gif">
<img src="tiles/T11.gif">
<img src="tiles/T12.gif">
<img src="tiles/T13.gif">
<img src="tiles/T14.gif">
<img src="tiles/T15.gif">
<img src="tiles/T16.gif">
<img src="tiles/T17.gif">
<img src="tiles/T18.gif">
<h3> The Bamboo (or Stick) Suit </h3>
<img src="tiles/T19.gif">
<img src="tiles/T20.gif">
<img src="tiles/T21.gif">
<img src="tiles/T22.gif">
<img src="tiles/T23.gif">
<img src="tiles/T24.gif">
<img src="tiles/T25.gif">
<img src="tiles/T26.gif">
<img src="tiles/T27.gif">
<p>
From left to right, the tiles have values 1 to 9.
There are 4 tiles for each value.
<a name="Tiles_Words"></a>
<h3> The Winds and Dragons (collectively called Words) </h3>
<img src="tiles/T28.gif">
<img src="tiles/T29.gif">
<img src="tiles/T30.gif">
<img src="tiles/T31.gif">
<img src="tiles/T32.gif">
<img src="tiles/T33.gif">
<img src="tiles/T34.gif">
<p>
The first 4 are <B>wind tiles</B> that correspond to the 4 directions: 
<B>East</B>, <B>South</B>, <B>West</B>,
and <B>North</B>.  There are 4 for each of these tiles.
This is also the order players' seats are named on the MahJong table:
starting from the <B>dealer</B> being <B>East</B>, 
rotating counterclockwise up to <B>North</B>.
<p>
The last 3 are <B>dragon tiles</B>, again there are 4 of each.
<h3> The Flowers </h3>
<img src="tiles/T35.gif">
<img src="tiles/T36.gif">
<img src="tiles/T37.gif">
<img src="tiles/T38.gif">
<img src="tiles/T39.gif">
<img src="tiles/T40.gif">
<img src="tiles/T41.gif">
<img src="tiles/T42.gif">
<p>
All the flower tiles are distinct.  They are not normal tiles and
play relatively minor roles in MahJong, mostly to introduce the factor
of "luck".
Some versions don't even use them, but we do.

<a name="Sets"></a>
<h2> Sets of Tiles </h2>
Here are some terminologies for certain sets of MahJong tiles.
Various people have various different names for them so beware.
<ul>
<a name="Set_Pair"></a>
<li>	A <B>pair</B> is a set of 2 identical tiles.  
<br>	For example:
<img src="tiles/T13.gif"><img src="tiles/T13.gif"> or
<img src="tiles/T30.gif"><img src="tiles/T30.gif">.
<a name="Set_Conn"></a>
<li>	A <B>connection</B> is a set of 3 tiles of the same suit,
in consecutive values.  
<br>	For example:
<img src="tiles/T5.gif"><img src="tiles/T6.gif"><img src="tiles/T7.gif"> or
<img src="tiles/T10.gif"><img src="tiles/T11.gif"><img src="tiles/T12.gif">.
Note that you cannot form a connection with word tiles.
<a name="Set_Trip"></a>
<li>	A <B>triplet</B> is a set of 3 identical tiles. 
<br>	For example:
<img src="tiles/T20.gif"><img src="tiles/T20.gif"><img src="tiles/T20.gif"> or
<img src="tiles/T33.gif"><img src="tiles/T33.gif"><img src="tiles/T33.gif">.
<a name="Set_Quad"></a>
<li>	A <B>quadruplet</B> is a set of 4 identical tiles.  
<br>	For example:
<img src="tiles/T28.gif"><img src="tiles/T28.gif"><img
src="tiles/T28.gif"><img src="tiles/T28.gif">.
</ul>
A [normal] <B>winning pattern</B> consists of 5 sets of normal tiles.
One of the sets must be a <B>pair</B>, the other 4 sets can be
<B>connections</B>, <B>triplets</B>, or <B>quadruplets</B>.
You can also have any number (including 0) of <B>flower</B> tiles.
Here is an example:
<p>
<img src="tiles/T1.gif"><img src="tiles/T2.gif"><img src="tiles/T3.gif">
<img src="tiles/T18.gif"><img src="tiles/T18.gif"><img src="tiles/T18.gif">
<img src="tiles/T19.gif"><img src="tiles/T19.gif"><img
src="tiles/T19.gif"><img src="tiles/T19.gif">
<img src="tiles/T28.gif"><img src="tiles/T28.gif"><img src="tiles/T28.gif">
<img src="tiles/T34.gif"><img src="tiles/T34.gif">

<a name="Round"></a>
<h2> Games and Rounds </h2>
There are 4 players on the table.  A random player is chosen to be the
<B>dealer</B>.  Each player then gets assigned a <B>seat wind</B>, starting
from the <B>dealer</B> being <B>East</B>, proceeding counterclockwise in
the order of the <a href="#Tiles_Words"><B>wind tiles</B></a>.
There is also a <B>round wind</B> for each game, for the very first game
it's always <B>East</B>.
<p>
If the <B>dealer</B> wins the game or if the game is a draw,
then he remains the <B>dealer</B> for the next game.
However, if someone other than the <B>dealer</B> wins the game,
then the next player in turn (who used to be <B>South</B>) will
be the <B>dealer</B> for the next game.
<p>
When the <B>dealer</B> has rotated a full round back to the very first one,
the <B>round wind</B> rotates to the next one in the <a href="#Tiles_Words">
<B>wind tiles</B></a>.

<a name="Game"></a>
<h2> A MahJong Game </h2>
In a MahJong game, each player conceals his private hand of tiles and 
reveals some of them as the game progresses.
Once some tiles are revealed, the player can no longer touch them.
There is also a big stockpile of concealed tiles to be drawn from.
<p>
To <B>draw</B> a tile, a player takes a tile from the stockpile on the table.
If it is a <B>flower</B>, he reveals it and keeps drawing until he gets a
normal tile.
<B>NB</B>: in normal games, players draw tiles from the beginning or the
end of the stockpile depending on the situation.  We don't make that
distinction in IMS.
<p>
Initially, each player draws 13 tiles.  The <B>dealer</B> draws a 14th one,
and the game starts, the <B>dealer</B> having the <B>turn</B>.
<p>
<a name="Game_Turn"></a>
The player in <B>turn</B> has the following options:
<ul>
<li>	<B>Discard</B> a tile.  
<br>	To do this in IMS, click on that tile, and press <B>[Discard]</B>.
<li>	Form a <a href="#Set_Quad"><B>quadruplet</B></a>
if he has 4 identical tiles in his private hand.  
Thus he makes a <B>concealed quadruplet</B>: 
the set of quadruplet has revealed status, but
the other players cannot see them until the game ends.
The player then <B>draw</B>s another tile to compensate for the quadruplet.
<br>	To do this in IMS, click on one of the 4 tiles, and press
<B>[Quadruplet]</B>.
<li>	Form a <a href="#Set_Quad"><B>quadruplet</B></a> 
if he already has a revealed <a href="#Set_Trip"><B>triplet</B></a> and
now has a 4th tile of the same kind.  This play may put the player at the
risk of <B>feed</B>ing another player's winning hand and count as a
<B>robbing quadruplet</B>.
If the play is safe, then the player makes a <B>revealed quadruplet</B>,
and <B>draw</B>s another tile to compensate.
<br>	To do this in IMS, click on the 4th tile, and press
<B>[Quadruplet]</B>.
<li>	Win the game, if he has a winning pattern.
<br>	To do this in IMS, simply press <B>[MahJong]</B>.
</ul>
If the player doesn't win, eventually he has to <B>discard</B> a tile.
Then the other 3 players make <B>bid</B>s for that tile and the next
turn to play.
<p>
For the <B>immediate successor</B> (in counterclockwise order)
of the player who just made the <B>discard</B>,
he has the following choices:
<ul>
<li>	<B>Bid</B> to <B>draw</B> another tile.
<br>	To do this in IMS, press <B>[Draw]</B>.
<li>	<B>Bid</B> to make a <a href="#Set_Conn"><B>connection</B></a> with
the discarded tile and 2 other tiles in his private hand.
<br>	To do this in IMS, press one of the 3 corresponding 
<B>[Connect]</B> buttons.
<li>	<B>Bid</B> to make a <a href="#Set_Trip"><B>triplet</B></a> with
the discarded tile and 2 same tiles in his private hand.
<br>	To do this in IMS, press <B>[Triplet]</B>.
<li>	<B>Bid</B> to make a <a href="#Set_Quad"><B>quadruplet</B></a> with
the discarded tile and 3 same tiles in his private hand.
<br>	To do this in IMS, press <B>[Quadruplet]</B>.
<li>	<B>Bid</B> to win the game (with a winning pattern)
after grabbing the discarded tile.
<br>	To do this in IMS, press <B>[MahJong]</B>.
</ul>
For the other 2 players, they have the following choices:
<ul>
<li>	<B>Bid</B> to <B>pass</B>, i.e. do nothing.
<br>	To do this in IMS, press <B>[Pass]</B>.
<li>	<B>Bid</B> to make a <a href="#Set_Trip"><B>triplet</B></a> with
the discarded tile and 2 same tiles in his private hand.
<br>	To do this in IMS, press <B>[Triplet]</B>.
<li>	<B>Bid</B> to make a <a href="#Set_Quad"><B>quadruplet</B></a> with
the discarded tile and 3 same tiles in his private hand.
<br>	To do this in IMS, press <B>[Quadruplet]</B>.
<li>	<B>Bid</B> to win the game (with a winning pattern)
after grabbing the discarded tile.
<br>	To do this in IMS, press <B>[MahJong]</B>.
</ul>
Note that only the <B>immediate successor</B> can make <B>connection</B>s.
<p>
<B>Bid</B>s have the following order of precedence:
<br>
<B>pass</B> &lt <B>draw</B> &amp <B>connection</B> &lt <B>triplet</B> &amp
<B>quadruplet</B> &lt <B>MahJong</B>.
<p>
If the table allows <B>multiple wins</B>, then all players who claims
<B>MahJong</B> win the game.
Otherwise, only the <B>closest successor</B> (in counterclockwise order)
of the player who just made the <B>discard</B> wins.
The player who just made the <B>discard</B> is the <B>feed</B>er.
<p>
If nobody wins, the player who has the highest <B>bid</B> makes his play:
<ul>
<li>	If his bid is <B>draw</B>, he draws a tile from the stockpile.
The game is declared a draw (i.e. nobody wins) if the stockpile has
less than 14 tiles.
<li>	If his bid is <B>connection</B> or <B>triplet</B>, he forms a new
revealed set with the discarded tile and his 2 other tiles.
<li>	If his bid is <B>quadruplet</B>, he forms a new revealed set with
the discarded tile and his 3 other tiles, then draws another tile to
compensate.
</ul>
Then, this player gets the next <a href="#Game_Turn"><B>turn</B></a>.
<p>
After someone wins the game, or if the game is a draw,
the <B>dealer</B>, <B>round wind</B> and <B>seat wind</B>s are rearranged
(see <a href="#Round">Games and Rounds</a>) and a new game starts.

<a name="Opts"></a>
<h2> IMS Table Options </h2>
There are certain options that you can set in IMS to have minor changes
on the game and scoring.
They are there mainly because there are literally dozens of different 
MahJong conventions, and we try to accomodate them within the general
framework set of IMS.
<ul>
<li>	<B>Count Flowers</B>.  This option controls whether or not possession
	of <B>flower tiles</B> should be rewarded.  The reward is not much
	(1 point per flower towards the final score), but there are versions
	of MahJong where flower tiles are not used at all, so turning this
	option off approximates those conventions.
<li>	<B>Multiple Wins</B>.  There are rare occasions when one player
	discards a tile that makes 2 or even all 3 of the other players
	complete a winning pattern.  In some conventions, only the nearest
	successor (in counterclockwise order) of that player can win, whereas
	in other conventions, all the players with a winning pattern can win.
<li>	<B>Minimum Fan</B>.  This option deals with the
	<a href="#Scoring">IMS scoring system</a>, which uses the notion
	<I>fan</I> that roughly measures how "good" a winning pattern is.
	Some gamblers set a minimum score in order to win.  In IMS, you can
	impose a minimum <I>fan</I> of 0 or 2.  A minimum <I>fan</I> of 2
	is pretty restrictive, and some players think it downplays some
	MahJong strategies.
</ul>
	
<a name="Scoring"></a>
<h2> IMS Scoring System </h2>
For each winning hand, we calculate two variables: <I>fan</I> and
<I>bonus</I>.  <I>Fan</I> is calculated additively from the following rules,
up to a maximum of 13.
<p>
We refer the reader to <a href="#Tiles">MahJong Tiles</a> and
<a href="#Sets">Sets of Tiles</a> for some
terminologies used below.
<ul>
<li>	Each triplet (or quadruplet) of the player's 
<a href="#Round"><B>seat wind</B></a> adds 1 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	Each triplet (or quadruplet) of the current 
<a href="#Round"><B>round wind</B></a> adds 1 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	Each triplet (or quadruplet) of the 
<a href="#Tiles_Words"><B>dragon tiles</B></a> adds 1 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	Each quadruplet (concealed or revealed) adds 1 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	"All Connections" (4 sets of connections) adds 1 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	"3 Sisters" (3 sets of connections in the same values in 
3 different suits) adds 1 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	"Snake" (3 sets of connections with values 
(1 2 3), (4 5 6), (7 8 9) in the same suit).  
If at least one of these 3 sets is revealed, it's a
"Revealed Snake", adds 2 <I>fan</I>.  If all of the 3 sets are concealed, it's
a "Concealed Snake", adds 3 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	"All Triplets" (4 sets of triplets) adds 3 <I>fan</I>.  If all the
tiles are word tiles, it's a "Pure Words", adds <I>max fan</I>.
<li>	"All 1&9" (all non-word sets contain 1 or 9), adds 2 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	"One Mixed Suit" (Except for 
<a href="#Tiles_Words">word</a> tiles, all other tiles 
belong to one suit), adds 3 <I>fan</I>.  If the hand has no word
tiles, it's a "One Pure Suit", adds 6 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	"Front Door Clean" (no revealed sets when winning, does not apply to
special patterns below) adds 1 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	"All Grabs" (all sets, including the final pair, are formed by
grabbing) adds 1 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	"Rob Quadruplet" (winning by grabbing the 4th tile of someone's
quadruplet) adds 1 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	"Win on Flower" (winning after drawing a flower tile or after making a
quadruplet) adds 1 <I>fan</I>.
</ul>
Plus the following <B>special patterns</B>:
<ul>
<li>	"7 Pairs" (7 sets of pairs) worth 5 <I>fan</I>.  If all the tiles
belong to one suit or to the words, it's a "Pure 7 Pairs", 
worth <I>max fan</I>.
<li>	"13 Individuals" (strictly (1 4 7), (2 5 8), (3 6 9) in 3 different
suits, plus 3 words and a distinct word pair) worth 6 <I>fan</I>.
<li>	"13 Orphans" (6 different 1's and 9's plus 7 different words, plus
another of the above 13) worth <I>max fan</I>.
</ul>
The <I>bonus</I> is calculated as follows:
<ul>
<li>	If the flag <B>count flowers</B> is on, each flower counts as 1
<I>bonus</I>. 
<li>	Each concealed quadruplet counts as 2 <I>bonus</I>.
<li>	The current dealer gets 5 <I>bonus</I>.
</ul>
The <I>score</I> of a hand is calculated by:
<ul>
<li>	If <I>fan</I> &lt=4, <I>score</I> = 2 ^ <I>fan</I> + <I>bonus</I>.
<li>	If <I>fan</I> &gt=4, <I>score</I> = <I>fan</I> ^ 2 + <I>bonus</I>.
</ul>
Payment in terms of points is made by:
<ul>
<li>	If you self-feed, every player pays you <I>score</I> points.
<li>	If someone <B>feed</B>s you, he pays you <I>score</I> points.  
The other 2 players pay you <I>bonus</I> points.
</ul>
