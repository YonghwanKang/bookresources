31.01.2003 (6h):

- Transform2Dto2D rewritten for easier usage
- selection rectangle for mouse dragging in ortho views

01.02.2003 (3h):

- creating polys by setting verts in ortho view enabled
- debugging aabb methods in 3d mathe lib

02.02.2003 (6h):
- selection in ortho view is now active
- added some aabb stuff to 3d math lib
- vertices can be selected and translated now
- debugged graphics output

03.02.2003 (5h):
- texture GUI with offset and repeat failed due to possible
  multiple selections which would kill existing coordinates
- created a new dialog for texture coordinates
- texture offset and repeat implemented via dialog
- bug fixed in bounding box recalc during mesh translation
- bug fixed in dragging selection rect in ortho views
- CLevelObject added as base class for all level stuff

04.02.2003 (4h):
- CSector and CLevel render methods interface simplified
- bug fixed in mesh class (base class attribute declaration-nasty)
- portals creation from 4-vert polys 
- portals can be added to sectors and be rendered
 
05.02.2003 (5h):
- portals now rendered as transparent pink polys
- polygon front- and backside can be flipped
- cleared up CApplication class render methods
- rendering partial polygon while user is creating a new poly
- memory (re-)allocation now in base class CLevelObject
- objects in selection buffer can be copied now

06.02.2003 (6h):
- unknown bug in saving material, size of texture name is lost
- CSelectionBuffer can now only handle lobs and vertices, not
  any more polys, meshs, ... which simplifies all operations
- CSector instances now also only operate on lobs in main parts

07.02.2003 (5h):
- bug fixed in loading polygons (m_pDad was not properly set 
  which lead to crash on deleting polys from meshs)
- straightened out level and sector attribute dialog boxes

08.02.2003 (2h):
- sector class is now working on CLevelObjects whereever possible

09.02.2003 (4h):
- skins can now be totally restored along with alpha information
- editor can save and load all skins used within a level
- fixed grid rendering quick'n dirty implementation
- camera menue set up and implemented

11.02.2003 (4h):
- skins can be created with a dialog to select a new texture
- two additional maps (detail, bump) can be added to skin
- change some details in ZFXD3D to enable multitexturing
- loading and saving of prefabs (simple list of polygons)

12.02.2003 (4h):
- render orthogonal grid methods revisited and sped up
- some performance tests and selection buffer reset bugfixes
- HULLWIRE mode exchanged with LINES mode due to performance

14.02.2003 (3h):
- some reorganization of code 
- level building

15.02.2003 (4h):
- random bugs in level loading, added interception code for
  corrupted data in level file during loading to inform user
- prefabs can now be saved with base texture which will be loaded
  during loading of prefab if not yet present in the level

16.02.2003 ():
- even a man needs sleep and sports

17.02.2003 (3h):
- some level building and bug hunting in level saving/loading

18.02.2003 (4h):
- finally level loading/saving bug fixed (hopefully *g*)
- even more level building and planning
- added ambient light dialog box for sector lighting

19.02.2003 (2h):
- fixed some small issues and continued working on level

17.03.2003 (4h):
- make use of shaders not exclusively to fixed function pipeline
- rendering level geometry with shaders now to make the per-pixel
  lighting run

18.03.2003 (4h)
- solved some minor problems in render DLL design, shaders now stable
- bug fixed in line rendering after using alpha blending

27.03.2003 (6h)
- entities base type rendered functional finally, now you can create
  entities from selected mesh objects
- squeezed some more performance out of the rendering process by
  adjusting state changes and rendering only if needed
  
31.03.2003 (2h)
- bug fixed in "hide unselected" option where all polys of a selected
  mesh were hidden due to missing IsSelected() request on the mesh.
- some minor changes here and there

02.04.2003 (5h)
- prepared the automatic connection from portals to each other and
  to door entities as well as automatic removal of those connections
- automatic connection between portals and doors completed
- bug fixed in portal copying method, id was not copied correctly

26.04.2003 (1h)
- adjusted speed of movebased translation and rotation in view windows
- added arbritrary rotating option to the already existing 90 degree
  rotate options to be more flexible in placing objects in the level

28.04.2003 (1h)
- several vertex formats added to the render dll, editor is now using
  a vertex structure with three texture coordinate pairs in order to
  enrich walls with detail and bump map coordinates

29.04.2003 (1h)
- added material edit menu to the editor an added functionality to
  render dll that material is taken into account when rendering 
  with shaders

20.06.2003 (2h)
- added CSpawnPoint class and its usage functionality to the editor
  to enable the level designer to place spawn points for players
  and bots into the level at will :)
