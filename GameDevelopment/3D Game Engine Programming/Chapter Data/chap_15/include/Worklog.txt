22.02.2003 (3h):
- project files and workspace created
- started octree class

23.02.2003 (4h):
- octree creation methods completed

03.03.2003 (3h):
- spottet that polys are not clipped but tree creation
  works at least
- some bugs in polygon clip method removed
- memory bounds invalidation debugged and removed

05.03.2003 (3h):
- got that bitch, polygon clip method finally bugfixed, back-
  face of aabb planes were not checked against poly edges
- smoothed out some stuff and now octree works with life fire data

06.03.2003 (6h):
- loading leveldata for rendering purposes also, creating
  static buffers from vertex manager and render
- need to add some functionality to the vertex manager to
  render from one buffer with different index calls
- rendering one sector from single vertex and index buffer is
  up and running smoothly by now 

20.3.2003 (4h):
- loading lights along with level geometry into their own class
- integrated rendering with omni light shaders but there is a
  severe bug making this feature useless for now due to blackness
- created class for portals in game to make player able to change
  sectors as there is now way of finding appropriate sectors for
  a given position from scratch fast enough

25.02.2003 (4h):
- portals can be rendered now for evaluation purposes
- improved collision detection via the octree
- rendering speed up multiple times be readjusting rendering
  process and introducing poly caches for each light object

28.03.2003 (5h):
- loading of entities implemented, concentrating on doors for now
- player can now activate sliding doors by pushing return key :))

02.04.2003 (1h):
- sliding doors can now switch on and off portals connected to them

06.04.2003 (3h):
- finally spotted bug in the COctree::GetFloor method and build a
  workaround to make it stable. Player can now move through the
  level with collision detection and correct height
- backface culling in ray-triangle intersection method does not
  work as intended

12.04.2003 (3h):
- GetFloor() method debuged and is now able to get the right floor
  height even through horizontal lying portals the player is on
- transition through portals into neighboring sectors is now working

03.05.2003 (3h)
- removed one minor bug concerning not executed height calculation 
  of non-moving player during free fall
- implemented return of collision plane in collision detection
- level loader rewritten to be smoother and more natural, now it
  also supports loading of meshs which were skipped till now

27.05.2003
- TIM'S ZEROTH BIRTHDAY THAT IS :)

02.06.2003 (3h)
- shadow volume class straightened out, can now handle arbitrary
  vertex data as long as position and normal are stored first in
  the vertex structure with six floats
- lights will only cast shadows with meshs now if the meshs are
  within the radius the light travels at maximum

-> BIG BABY BREAK :)

14.06.2003 (4h)
- character animation class integrated into the game code
- some minor adjustments to straighten out this and that

15.06.2003 (4h)
- zfx network DLL coupled to the game code to add networking
  component and be able to create client and server game part
- no separate server class due to simplicity of this demo

16.06.2003 (4h)
- client and server are now in ready to combat state
- bullet list class added to game code to make game objects able
  to create arbitrary valued bullets in the game
- collision detection for bullets with level geometry and other
  players

17.06.2003 (1h)
- bullets are now able to keep track of the sector they are in
  using a check whether they traversed a portal during their flight

20.06.2003 (1h)
- loading of respawn points fpr players from level file integrated
- level class can now offer a random respawn position if queried
  along with the associated sector ID so there is no hardcoding 
  of initial positions for players anymore

21.06.2003 (2h)
- sending messages moved away from CGame class to CGameCharacter
  and other appropriate classes to make objects self-contained
- bug in ZFXNetworkDevice::SendToServer fixed so that a server
  application can now receive msg it sent to itself beforehand
