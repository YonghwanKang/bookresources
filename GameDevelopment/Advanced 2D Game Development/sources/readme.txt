Advanced2D Sources

Only the Debug configuration for each project has been configured for use, not the release build. If you would like to use the release build, refer to the text for instructions on how to configure a project with the appropriate libs.

The final version of the engine in the \Advanced2D Engine folder includes both Debug and Release configurations.
