I. INTRODUCTION
	

   Hey Hey! Welcome to the wonderful world of game programming. This CD, from 
   "Game Programming for Teens," includes everything needed to work with the 
   book. Included is the source, sample programs, sample games, royalty-free art,
   and some sample music.

   Within each directory there is a README.TXT file that explains what
   the files are and what they are for. The CD is set up like this:

   <DIR> - The main directory.
      |
      \Source        <DIR> - Contains the entire source code for the book.
      \Art           <DIR> - Contains sample art you can use in your programs.
      \Sounds        <DIR> - Contains sound and music for use.
      \Games         <DIR> - Contains some games for you to try out.
      \Programs      <DIR> - Contains some applications..
      


II. INSTALLING THE SOURCE CODE FROM THE BOOK

     The source code and data for each chapter of this book are contained
     within the SOURCE\ sub-directory. I suggest simply copying the entire
     SOURCE\ directory as-is onto your hard drive by "dragging" it from
     the CD.

III.   INSTALLING THE APPLICATIONS

     There are a number of awesome applications that are contained on this
     CD such as MilkShape 3d, Paint Shop Pro, Cool Edit Pro, and the Blitz
     Basic program itself.

     Each one of these applications installs as a self extracting .EXE and
     takes just a couple minutes. Take a look at the README.TXT file for
     each application for details.


IV.  PLAYING THE GAMES :)

     Definitely try out these games. They show what one can do with the Blitz
     Basic programming language. One of the games, Galaxiga, includes the 
     source code as well!


V. PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER

     * Read Only Flag *

     This is a very important detail, so read on. When creating a CD ROM disk
     all the files will be written with the READ-ONLY flag enabled. This is 
     fine in most cases unless you copy the files to your hard drive (which you will)
     and then edit and try to write the files back to disk. You will get a 
     READ-ONLY protection error. 

     Fixing this is a snap. You simply need to clear the READ-ONLY flag on any 
     files that you want to modify. The easiest way to do it is to navigate to
     the copied folder with windows, press the RIGHT mouse button and go into
     file properties, and clear the READ-ONLY flag and select APPLY. You can 
     do this to an entire directory or to each individual file.

     

Enjoy the CD!


"9:13-Personal Note-When I was a little kid, my mother told me not to stare into 
the sun. So once when I was six I did. The doctors didn't 
know if my eyes would ever heal. I was terrified, alone in that darkness. 
Slowly, daylight crept in through the bandages, and I could see. But something 
else had changed inside me. That day I had my first headache."

"You ain't got no rhyme, no, you gonna lose big time, cause no MC has ever survived,
who went up against Prime."
