/******************************************************************/
Application Name: Bspline

Application Description: 
    Simple application to show b-spline curves in action.


/******************************************************************/
Application Name: InvKim

Application Description: 
    Application showing a two segment linkage with an IK 
    solution to the mouse location.  Note that the app grabs
    exclusive control of the mouse; alt-f4, q, and esc will
    exit.

                      installed DDraw device installed

/******************************************************************/
Application Name: Radiosity

Application Description: 
    Radiosity calculator; loads in a hard-coded data file and 
    computes the radiosity solution for it progressively, showing
    it's partial solution as it progresses.


/******************************************************************/
Application Name: SubDiv

Application Description: 
    Takes an .o3d file to load on the command line and allows you 
    to subdivide it repeatedly.  The file must have no holes in it
    (so robot.o3d won't work)


/******************************************************************/
Application Name: Teapot

Application Description: 
    Loads in a hardcoded bezier patch file and displays it, allowing
    the user to tesselate the model.
