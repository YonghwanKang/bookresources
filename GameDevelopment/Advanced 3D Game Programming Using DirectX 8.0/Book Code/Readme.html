<h1>Compiling info</h1>
<p>To compile the book code provided on this CD you'll need to do a few things.</p>
<h3>1. Copy files off the CD</h3>
<p>The first step is to copy the entire directory tree (starting in this
directory) to your hard drive.&nbsp; You can exclude certain chapters if you
like, but the DevStudio Workspace (dsw) files in the &quot;chapter xx&quot;
directories are counting on all the files below them being there.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Install DirectX 8.0a</h3>
<p>Next you need to make sure DirectX 8.0 or above is installed on your
machine.&nbsp; For your convenience the 8.0a SDK is included on this CD.&nbsp;
You should also make sure you have the newest version of your video card drivers
installed.&nbsp; Check their web site.</p>
<p>For sanity's sake, you should install the debug run-time of the DirectX dll's.&nbsp;
They provide lots of error checking to help you find bugs.</p>

<h3>3. Set up DirectX in Visual Studio</h3>
<p>Visual Studio ships with the headers for DirectX 3.0.&nbsp; You need to do
some work to make sure that the compiler can find the 8.0 headers (for
compiling) and 8.0 libraries (for linking).&nbsp; To do this, go to the
tools-&gt;options area, and click on the 'directories' tab.&nbsp; Set up things
to look like they do in the following two images (of course, using the directory
where you installed the SDK... on my machine it's in d:\mssdk).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="setup2.jpg" width="417" height="319"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="setup3.jpg" width="417" height="319"></p>
<p>The important thing is to make sure the DirectX 8 files are at the top of the
list (by default they'll be put at the bottom).&nbsp; When the compiler needs a
header (like d3d8.h) it searches the list from top to bottom.&nbsp; It needs to
search the DX8 directory (with the 8.0 version of the header) before it searches
the VC include directories (which have the 3.0 version of the D3D header).</p>
<h3>4. Getting new projects to compile</h3>
<p>The above 3 steps should be enough to make the provided chapters and projects
compile correctly.&nbsp; If you want to create new projects using the provided
code, you can do the following:</p>
<p>If the workspace you're using has the libraries made in the game (GameLib,
Math3d, and NetLib, though you may not need all three), the best thing to do is
to set up dependencies for those projects (in
project-&gt;Dependencies...).&nbsp; For example, here is the dependency dialog
for the GameClient project.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="setup5.jpg" width="320" height="222"></p>
<p>The other thing you'll need to do is link all the right libraries (in
Project-&gt;Settings...).&nbsp; Any project using GameLib needs the following
libraries linked:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; winmm.lib d3d8.lib dxguid.lib dinput8.lib dsound.lib
d3dx8.lib</p>
<p>Any project using NetLib needs the winsock DLL:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ws2_32.lib</p>
<p>Finally, if the libraries aren't in the workspace and you just have the
actual .lib files sitting in the directory, you need to link them in too.&nbsp;</p>
