Welcome to the world of Compilation. This CD contents will help you to get all the source codes developed in our book on Compiler Design.
All the programs are tested in Linux Platform (CentOS,Fedora), and cygwin in Windows Platform).
The CD has been organized to provide the contents as follows:
1.	Source code for generating Intermediate Code for a language similar to C language as discussed in Chapter 6
2.	Source code for generating the 8086 machine code as discussed in Chapter 8
3.	Source code for generating the Intermediate Code for C language using the tools Lex and Yacc tools for the scanning and parsing as discussed in Appendix-A
4.  Source code for generating the Intermediate Code for C lanaguage using the Javacc for the scanning and parsing as discussed in Appendix-B
5.	Source Code for all the laboratory exercises as discussed in Appendix-C
6.  Source code for a very simple mini compiler for a C language (Only few features of the languages are covered. The rest is left to the reader to exercis)

Basically all the codes are developed and tested in Linux environment. In order to migrate the work in Microsoft Windows environment, a tool named cygwin is used.
The steps for working with the codes in these six sections are as follows:

Linux:
Goto the folder where the files (source code, test input C files) are present
For the first four sections run the make command (before executing the make command, open the file makefile and study the linkage of all the files involed).

Windows:
Install cygwin software (freely downloadable from www.cygwin.com - also available in the CD)
The home folder for the cygwin may look as follows:
	D:\cygwin\home\muni\compiler\sourcecode
Goto the cygwin home folder in the command line
Create any sub folder based on your requirements
Copy all the required source files into this folder
Run the make command
Run the exe file ...
	Wish you all success!!!
