JavaCC is a tool enabling the language designer to specify the lexical and syntax specifications.
In generates a set of Java files which are meant for the scanning and parsing the source program.
Along with the specification the semantic actions can be attached so the intermediate code corresponding source code can be generated.
We have used the quadruples as the intermediate code.

When the specification files are processed by JavaCC, it produces the following files as follows:
CParser.java
CParserConstants.java
CParserTokenManager.java
JavaCharStream.java
ParseException.java
Token.java
TokenMgrError.java
These files compiled using Javac produces the scanner and parser routines.
