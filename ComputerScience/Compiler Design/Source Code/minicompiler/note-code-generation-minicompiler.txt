Code generation is the last phase of the compilation. To generate the machine code, the knowledge of the assembly language and machine language format is essential.
In chapter 8, the machine code generation was explained for few instructions. However, the process of machine code generation is cumbersome. It has to be automated.
In this section the process of machine code generation for a very limited version of C language is demonstrated passing through different stages of scanning, parsing, generating intermediate code, and machine code generatio.

There two sub sections are presented. Embedding and Linking Format (ELF) is standard file format in Linux platform for creating a executable file.
It is more involved in working with different headers. Basically ELF file is organized as a header, different segments split into multiple sections and its associated headers.
In this sections a ELF file format demo is given. Using the existing ELF file format, the machine code for the give C source language is embedded into the ELF file for the demonstration of a mini C compiler.

This section has two parts. 1) ELF demo 2) Mini Compiler
